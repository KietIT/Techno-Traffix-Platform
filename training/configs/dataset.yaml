# Vietnam Traffic Dataset Configuration for YOLO Training
# This file defines the dataset structure and class labels

# Dataset paths (relative to this file or absolute)
# On Kaggle, these will be set to /kaggle/working/dataset/...
path: ./vietnam_traffic_dataset  # Root directory
train: images/train              # Training images (relative to path)
val: images/val                  # Validation images (relative to path)
test: images/test                # Test images (optional, relative to path)

# Number of classes
nc: 5

# Class names - ORDER MATTERS (must match label indices 0-4)
names:
  0: car
  1: truck
  2: motorcycle
  3: bus
  4: ambulance

# Class descriptions for reference
# car: All passenger vehicles (sedan, SUV, hatchback, etc.)
# truck: Freight vehicles (pickup trucks, delivery trucks, semi-trucks)
# motorcycle: Two-wheeled vehicles including motorbikes and bicycles
# bus: Public transport buses and coaches
# ambulance: Emergency medical vehicles (with or without lights on)

# Dataset statistics (update after labeling)
# train_images: ~1200
# val_images: ~300
# test_images: ~200

# Augmentation settings (used in training notebook)
augmentation:
  hsv_h: 0.015      # HSV-Hue augmentation
  hsv_s: 0.7        # HSV-Saturation augmentation
  hsv_v: 0.4        # HSV-Value augmentation
  degrees: 0.0      # Rotation (disabled for traffic cameras)
  translate: 0.1    # Translation
  scale: 0.5        # Scale augmentation
  shear: 0.0        # Shear (disabled)
  perspective: 0.0  # Perspective (disabled for fixed cameras)
  flipud: 0.0       # Vertical flip (disabled - cars don't flip)
  fliplr: 0.5       # Horizontal flip
  mosaic: 1.0       # Mosaic augmentation
  mixup: 0.0        # MixUp augmentation
